History
========
Originally Jonne was developed by Tuomas Numminen as a "fun project" in
early Summer 2012. Back then, it didn't have any name and it was called
just 'test'.

July 2012 a new member joined to the developers of the game, Juhani
Numminen. The authors decided then to make the project available for
public as open source. A name had to be made up, so 'Jonne' was chosen.

Initially the license of choice was the BDS 3-clause, but it was soon
replaced by the 2-clause version.
